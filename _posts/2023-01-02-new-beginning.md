Hi There!

Here we go with first post of 2023! I decided (again) to move my simple website/blog to a different platform: [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) support.

Reasons for this choice is to have direct control over the writing, to keep simple and effective the editing and lastly to learn somenting new!

This way of life (learning somenting new every day) is like a mantra in my mind and is just a way to cohabit with my curiosity and passions in many area: from **cyber security** to **dog training**, from **treckking** to **photography**, from **coding** to **lifeguarding**, from **music** to **maths** and many others.

Keeping strong focus on what I'm working on, with such number of interests/passions, is a difficult task and I have to  be more disciplined and organized to plan carefully learning paths and activities to don't be overhelmed by the **things**!

Having said that, this blog will continue to be **100% cyber security focused**. Many other arguments should be discussed but I need to be focused and I prefer to keep it simple. Probably sometime I could publish some extra contents for sake of curiosity.


## next steps
Let me do a list of resolutions as per tradition is done at the year beginning. It's just a starting point, a **new beginning**, to track what I'm going to do with this 2023.

- porting my posts from other platform to githubpages
- starting again the [**hack the box**](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/3359) and in general CTF activities
- contributing the developer/hacker community publishing code

## why
Looking back, over my shoulder, I tryed several time to keep my blog updated with learning activities, coding, or with info about me.... but it never happend. Now the blog is opened since 2017 and many years are passed...

The question about *why keep open this blog again in 2023* came in my mind.... I think it's important to have a way to track our activities, interests, and contributing in  our community. Writing could be a useful way to improve written skills and for me, English Language also.

## conclusions
So, wish me **good luck** for the new beginning, with the hope to have material to contribute with the community!
