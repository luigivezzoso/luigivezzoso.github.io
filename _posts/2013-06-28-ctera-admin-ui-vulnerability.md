Some CTERA [cloud attached storage](http://www.ctera.com/) are vulnerable to **Direct Object References** permitting some information disclosure to authenticated user (with no administration permission). For example a user can obtain the full list of users with their emails etc.

**CTERA R&D had solved this issue into 3.2.47 firmware release. So this issue must affect just version prior 3.2.47.**

It’s not a critical vulnerability because usually this appliances are used into a company and or/corporate environment so the user info are often available to all. **If this appliances were used to provide services to external users this can be a risky vulnerability.**

Steps for reproduce the issue:

1. Login into appliances with standard user

2. After loggedin. Change the URL parameter to ConfigTab

3. As you can see the standard user can access to configuration interface of appliance.
