It's been a long time since I wrote last post... Many things are changed in my life and now I will try to restart again, sometimes a CTRL-ALT-CANC is required to make the system work again.

Just to share some important updates in my life I can mention the following events:

- I worked harder to become a K9 Rescue Unit of the "Scuola Italiana Cani Salvataggio". It wasn't easy and required a lot of dedication and work on my mindset and physical status too. But I'm proud of It and now my Dog and Me already done two summer season supervising Italian free-beaches with my wonderful Team!

- I changed my Job. After many years in the same company (so many to become a Family) I decided to quit in order to have new challenges, new way of work, more work/life balancing, etc. I am honored to have been a part of such great company and worked with some of most talented people.


Is still in me the need of sharing experience, thoughts, knowledge, etc. mostly I think, because the community gave us the opportunity to grow personally and technically and we need feed It as we can.

The main reason of this blog is to track my activities in the Cyber Security as a sort of notepad with the intention of fix concepts in my mind... no more, no less.

I think writing note and trying to summarize/explain them to others  could be very useful.

*If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough. – Albert Einstein*

These are my proposal/resolution for 2021 about my online activities:

- writing a post per week
- contribute at-least one community project


If you have any suggestion about community project which can be supported, please let me know.

With hope for a great #2021! Be Safe! #Happy Near!
